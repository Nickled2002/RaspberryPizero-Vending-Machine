# RaspberryPizero-Vending-Machine
This project was  an IoT project from my Uni module it utilises AWS and an MQTT broker to simulate a vending machine being used.
The pin controls are done through the Pis LKM.
The leds are used as placeholders for relays that would pass current to a servo that would spin for the apropriate ammount of time for an item to be dispenced.
#This project was reworked on an d used for two offerholder days in the university where the aws component was not utilised and servos would spin at on their own without the use of the Pi's LKM.
