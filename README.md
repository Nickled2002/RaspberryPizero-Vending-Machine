# RaspberryPizero-Vending-Machine
This project was  an IoT project from my Uni module it utilises AWS and an MQTT broker to simulate a vending machine being used.
The pin controls are done through the Pis LKM.
The LEDs are used as placeholders for relays that would pass current to a servo that would spin for the appropriate amount of time for an item to be dispensed.
# This project was reworked on and used for two offer holder days in the university where the aws component was not utilised and servos would spin at on their own without the use of the Pi's LKM.
